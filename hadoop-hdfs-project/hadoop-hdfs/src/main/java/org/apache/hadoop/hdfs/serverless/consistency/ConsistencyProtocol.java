        // WARNING:
        // This description is slightly out-dated, as we now use ZooKeeper to store ACKs and INVs.
        // The general steps and order of operations remains unchanged, however. Instead of storing ACKs
        // and INVs as entries in an NDB table, we use ephemeral ZNodes stored in ZooKeeper. Just as each
        // deployment had its own ACK and INV table in NDB, each deployment has an associated persistent ZNode
        // for ACKs and another for INVs.
        //
        // TERMINOLOGY:
        // - Leader NameNode: The NameNode performing the write operation.
        // - Follower NameNode: NameNode instance from the same deployment as the Leader NameNode.
        //
        // The updated consistency protocol for Serverless NameNodes is as follows:
        // (1) The Leader NN begins listening for changes in group membership from ZooKeeper.
        //     The Leader will also subscribe to events on the ACKs table for reasons that will be made clear shortly. We
        //     need to subscribe first to ensure we receive notifications from follower NNs ACK'ing the entries.
        //     IMPORTANT: Another reason we must subscribe BEFORE adding the ACKs is that, if we add our ACKs first, then
        //     another NN could issue an INV that causes one of our followers to check for ACKs. They see the ACKs we just
        //     added and ACK them, but we haven't subscribed yet! So, we miss the notification, and our protocol fails as
        //     a result. Thus, we must subscribe BEFORE adding any ACKs to intermediate storage.
        // (2) The Leader NN adds N-1 un-ACK'd records to the "ACKs" table of the Leader's deployment, where N is the
        //     number of nodes in the Leader's deployment. (N-1 as it does not need to add a record for itself.)
        // (3) The leader issues one INV per modified INode to the target deployment's INV table.
        // (4) Follower NNs will ACK their entry in the ACKs table upon receiving the INV from intermediate storage (NDB).
        //     The follower will also invalidate its cache at this point, thereby readying itself for the upcoming write.
        // (5) The Leader listens for updates on the ACK table, waiting for all entries to be ACK'd.
        //     If there are any NN failures during this phase, the Leader will detect them via ZK. The Leader does not
        //     need ACKs from failed NNs, as they invalidate their cache upon returning.
        // (6) Once all ACKs are received, the leader continues with the operation.
